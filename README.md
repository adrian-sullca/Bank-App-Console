BankApp is an application executable on the terminal with connection to a database, which will be responsible for managing transactions and 
accounts for the different users who can register in the application. When registering a user, an account number is also created for this new user.

Registered users can perform the following actions:

-Open new bank accounts

-View their active bank accounts

-Close an existing bank account

-Perform financial transactions including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. For transfers, users will need to specify the target account 
number where the funds will be transferred.


NOTE: Before starting and testing the application, make sure to create the database.properties file with your connection properties 
(The file named database.properties.example is provided as an example).
